#### What's Soosyrv Rule
Soosyrv-8 rule has been chosen as World Championship rule since 2017.
> The first player puts one of the 26 openings.    
> The other player has the right to swap.    
> The player who takes white puts the 4th move anywhere and declares how many fifth moves should be played (from 1 to 8).     
> The other player has the right to swap.    
> The player who takes black should put as many 5th moves on the board as it was previously declared. The fifth moves should not be symmetrical.    
> The white player choses one 5th moves from these offerings and plays the 6th move.     
> After the opening stage the game continues by renju rule.
